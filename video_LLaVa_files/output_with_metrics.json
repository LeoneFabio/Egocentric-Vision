The location of the tile cutter in the photo seems to be unconventional as it is not being used for cutting the tile at the moment, and it's not in the correct position to do so.\n\n\nIf you need to cut a tile, you would first place the tile cutter on the tile with the blade facing downwards, then press down to cut along the line you've drawn. If you're cutting multiple tiles or large tiles, it's important to place the tile cutter on each tile in turn, then cut them one at a time. It's also helpful to have a flat surface to support the tile during cutting, like a table or another tile, and cutting in a controlled and steady motion.\n\n\nRemember to also take precautions when using a tile cutter, as it can be dangerous if you don't use it correctly. Always use it in a well-ventilated area and ensure you have a firm grip before starting the cutting. If this is a construction site or a renovation project, it's also good to have protective gear such as goggles and gloves for eye protection and to prevent the tile from breaking or the tile cutter from slipping.",
